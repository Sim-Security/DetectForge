title: Exfiltration to OneDrive via Non-Standard Process
id: 26b42320-ee3d-452a-81d1-5be8e440bf3f
status: experimental
description: Detects network connections to Microsoft OneDrive (onedrive.live.com) initiated by processes that are not standard web browsers or the official OneDrive sync client. This behavior is consistent with custom exfiltration tools like CovalentStealer which target cloud storage for data theft.
