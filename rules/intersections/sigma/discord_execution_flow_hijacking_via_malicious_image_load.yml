title: Discord Execution Flow Hijacking via Malicious Image Load
id: e724aea3-a871-4ad5-b4e5-eb4638d2b4f6
status: experimental
description: Detects the loading of suspicious or unsigned modules by a process masquerading as Discord, or Discord loading unusual hidden files. This behavior is consistent with HLOADER and KANDYKORN malware which renames the legitimate Discord binary to a hidden file like '.lock' and replaces it with a malicious loader.
