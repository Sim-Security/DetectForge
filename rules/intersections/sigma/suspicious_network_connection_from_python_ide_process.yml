title: Suspicious Network Connection from Python IDE Process
id: 79584b06-e2c9-46e7-b1ca-38f26f5e4c6e
status: experimental
description: Detects Python interpreters or IDE-related processes (like PyCharm) initiating outbound network connections to external hosting services or suspicious domains. This behavior is consistent with multi-stage malware infections where a victim is social-engineered into running a malicious script (e.g., an arbitrage bot) that fetches secondary payloads.
