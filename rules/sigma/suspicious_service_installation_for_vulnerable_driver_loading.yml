title: Suspicious Service Installation for Vulnerable Driver Loading
id: b18095e0-8d35-4c68-998c-89644dc2560f
status: experimental
description: Detects the installation of Windows services associated with known vulnerable drivers (RTCore64.sys, DBUtil_2_3.sys) often used in Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks to disable EDR/AV protections by stripping PPL flags. This behavior is consistent with tools like EDRSandBlast used by SVR actors.
