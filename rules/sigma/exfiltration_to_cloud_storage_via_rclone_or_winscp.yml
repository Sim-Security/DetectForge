title: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage via RClone or WinSCP
id: 4a3941ac-a886-4732-b7b7-9514de7cb0cb
status: experimental
description: Detects network connections initiated by RClone or WinSCP to common cloud storage destinations or over standard web ports. This behavior is frequently associated with data exfiltration prior to ransomware deployment, specifically using tools to sync local data to actor-controlled cloud accounts.
