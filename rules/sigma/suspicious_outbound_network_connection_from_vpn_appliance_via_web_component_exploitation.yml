title: Suspicious Outbound Network Connection from VPN Appliance via Web Component Exploitation
id: fa484f21-b72b-4c8b-9ab6-c9a6c00be946
status: experimental
description: Detects outbound network connections from processes associated with web services or system utilities on VPN appliances, which may indicate post-exploitation activity following the abuse of CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887. Attackers often use curl, wget, or ssh to exfiltrate data or fetch secondary payloads after gaining RCE via vulnerable CGI endpoints.
