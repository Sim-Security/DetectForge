title: Suspicious Security Log Cleared by User Account
id: 050fe472-5f7a-46ef-9fbb-57782f6c0696
status: experimental
description: Detects the manual clearing of the Windows Security event log (Event ID 1102) by interactive user accounts or domain users. This behavior is commonly associated with threat actors attempting to destroy forensic evidence and obscure their operational activities during post-exploitation phases, including incidents involving compromised VPN infrastructure where attackers clear logs to hide their tracks on management hosts.
