title: Security Tool Exclusion Modification via Scripting Interpreter
id: 405d038d-692e-47f9-97e0-2b65a5feeecd
status: experimental
description: Detects modifications to antivirus or antimalware exclusion lists in the Windows Registry, particularly when performed by scripting interpreters or command-line tools. This behavior is commonly observed when threat actors attempt to hide web shells or other malicious components from security scanning, analogous to manipulating Integrity Checker Tool exclusions in compromised VPN appliances to maintain persistence.
