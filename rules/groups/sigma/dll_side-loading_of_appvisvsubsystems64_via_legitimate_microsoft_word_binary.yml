title: DLL Side-Loading of AppVIsvSubsystems64 via Legitimate Microsoft Word Binary
id: 71491b59-826b-406b-acd4-3ada5afb1939
status: experimental
description: Detects the loading of a potentially malicious DLL named APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll by a process named windoc.exe (often a renamed or legitimate Microsoft Word binary). This pattern is indicative of DLL side-loading, where a signed executable is used to load an unsigned or malicious library from the same directory to bypass security controls.
