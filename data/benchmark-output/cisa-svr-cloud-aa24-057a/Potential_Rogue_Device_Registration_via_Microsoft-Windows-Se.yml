title: Potential Rogue Device Registration via Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing
id: 9ba41818-a2b4-433f-8b25-19f2de04a25f
status: experimental
description: Detects potential rogue device registration activity by monitoring for specific service-related events and logon patterns associated with device enrollment. Attackers register their own devices to bypass conditional access policies and maintain persistence within a cloud-integrated environment.
