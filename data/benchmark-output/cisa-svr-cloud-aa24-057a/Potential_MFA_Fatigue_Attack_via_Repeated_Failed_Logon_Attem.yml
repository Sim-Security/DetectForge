title: Potential MFA Fatigue Attack via Repeated Failed Logon Attempts
id: 81031847-5d89-4fb7-9fe3-854ae369bb18
status: experimental
description: Detects patterns indicative of MFA bombing or fatigue attacks where a high volume of failed logon attempts (Status 0xC000006D, 0xC000006A) occur for a single user, potentially followed by a successful logon. This rule monitors Windows Security Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon) which often precedes or accompanies MFA push notification spamming in hybrid environments.
