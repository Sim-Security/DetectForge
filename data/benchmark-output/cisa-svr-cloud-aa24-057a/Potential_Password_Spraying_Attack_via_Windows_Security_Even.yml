title: Potential Password Spraying Attack via Windows Security Event Logs
id: dd413fb4-8ff4-4aac-8732-a1cdfbedcb14
status: experimental
description: Detects patterns indicative of password spraying attacks where multiple failed logon attempts are recorded across different target accounts from a single source. This rule focuses on Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon) with specific logon types associated with network and remote access, which aligns with the TTP of systematic brute-force against service accounts.
