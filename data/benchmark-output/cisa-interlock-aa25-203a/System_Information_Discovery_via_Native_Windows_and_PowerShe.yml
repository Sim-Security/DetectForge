title: System Information Discovery via Native Windows and PowerShell Commands
id: 33deb7e2-fe21-4be1-ac9d-bf7d09802b02
status: experimental
description: Detects the execution of multiple system discovery commands such as systeminfo, tasklist /svc, and arp -a, alongside PowerShell-based enumeration of drives and services. This activity is characteristic of the reconnaissance phase where an attacker attempts to map system configuration and network topology.
