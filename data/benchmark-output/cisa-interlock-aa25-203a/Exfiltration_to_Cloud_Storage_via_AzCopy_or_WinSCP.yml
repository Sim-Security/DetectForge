title: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage via AzCopy or WinSCP
id: 83138b5c-bc93-4eaf-994b-dedfb57aff98
status: experimental
description: Detects network connections to Azure Blob Storage endpoints initiated by tools commonly used for data exfiltration such as AzCopy, WinSCP, or Azure Storage Explorer. Attackers leverage these legitimate tools to move stolen data to attacker-controlled cloud environments, often masquerading as administrative traffic.
