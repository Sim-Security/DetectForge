title: Creation of Interlock Ransomware Artifacts via File Events
id: 212ec1b1-fa51-4586-9902-44f2a05d82b0
status: experimental
description: Detects the creation of ransom notes and files with specific extensions associated with Interlock ransomware. Interlock uses a combined AES-RSA algorithm to encrypt files and appends extensions such as .interlock or .1nt3rlock, while dropping a ransom note named !__README__!.txt for extortion purposes.
