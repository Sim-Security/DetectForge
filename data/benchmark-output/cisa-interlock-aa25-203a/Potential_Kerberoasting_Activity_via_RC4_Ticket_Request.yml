title: Potential Kerberoasting Activity via RC4 Ticket Request
id: 7a631344-0e3c-4654-acd8-efd6f7a2c1d7
status: experimental
description: Detects Kerberos service ticket requests (Event ID 4769) using RC4 encryption (0x17). This is a common indicator of Kerberoasting attacks, where actors request tickets for service accounts to crack the hashes offline. This specific encryption type is often targeted because it is weaker than AES. This rule aligns with observed TTPs involving service account hash extraction.
