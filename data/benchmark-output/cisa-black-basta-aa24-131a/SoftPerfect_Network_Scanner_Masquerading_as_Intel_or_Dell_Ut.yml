title: SoftPerfect Network Scanner Masquerading as Intel or Dell Utility
id: 5f86a475-4cf4-4bd1-9213-54dd8b8fd998
status: experimental
description: Detects the execution of SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe) where the binary has been renamed to 'intel.exe' or 'dell.exe' to masquerade as a legitimate system utility. This technique is frequently used by threat actors for internal network discovery while evading detection.
